This repository contains data and notebooks related to the DEA'S Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System, or ARCOS. 

According to the DEA's website, ARCOS "monitors the flow of DEA controlled substances from their point of manufacture through commercial distribution channels to point of sale or distribution at the dispensing/retail level - hospitals, retail pharmacies, practitioners, mid-level practitioners, and teaching institutions....these transactions...are then summarized into reports which give investigators in Federal and state government agencies information which can then be used to identify the diversion of controlled substances into illicit channels of distribution. The information on drug distribution is used throughout the United States (U.S.) by U.S. Attorneys and DEA investigators to strengthen criminal cases in the courts."

So, ARCOS exists to help the government identify patterns in the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances that might indicate that these substances are being sold illegally. Annual ARCOS reports are publically available on the DEA's website, dating back to the year 2000, but unfortunately they are only available in PDF form and are dozens or even hundreds of pages long.

I was interested in doing some data analysis on some of the controlled substances the DEA tracks, opioid painkillers in particular.

Aside from the important and interesting information it contains, ARCOS data also presents a great data cleansing challenge, given that it is distributed in PDFs - the perfect opportunity to practice pandas skills, for example. 

The Jupyter notebooks included in the repo are meant to demo the functionality of pandas and Jupyter notebooks for data cleansing and analysis - working with this data was a great project for me to improve my pandas skills and I'm sharing the code here so others can learn and practice.
