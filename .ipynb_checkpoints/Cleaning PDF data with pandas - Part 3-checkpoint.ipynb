    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is ARCOS?\n",
    "The DEA publishes data annually from its Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System, or ARCOS. According to the DEA's website, ARCOS \"monitors the flow of DEA controlled substances from their point of manufacture through commercial distribution channels to point of sale or distribution at the dispensing/retail level - hospitals, retail pharmacies, practitioners, mid-level practitioners, and teaching institutions....these transactions...are then summarized into reports which give investigators in Federal and state government agencies information which can then be used to identify the diversion of controlled substances into illicit channels of distribution. The information on drug distribution is used throughout the United States (U.S.) by U.S. Attorneys and DEA investigators to strengthen criminal cases in the courts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ARCOS exists to help the government identify patterns in the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances that might indicate that these substances are being sold illegally. Annual ARCOS reports are publically available on the DEA's website, dating back to the year 2000, but unfortunately they are only available in PDF form and are dozens or even hundreds of pages long. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's in this notebook?\n",
    "I was interested in doing some data analysis and visualization on the distribution of oxycodone, an opioid painkiller that is one of the main drivers of the current prescription pain pill (and arguably heroin) addiction epidemic in the United States right now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from a wealth of fascinating (and sometimes disturbing, sad, and frightening) data to explore, the ARCOS data also presents a great data cleansing challenge, given that it is distributed in PDFs - the perfect opportunity to practice your pandas skills, for example. Luckily, the files tend to have nearly identical formatting, aside from a shift in report formatting in 2006 and a few anomalies here and there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is also meant to show the functionality of pandas and Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning - working with this data was a great project for me to improve my pandas skills and I'm sharing the code here so others can learn and practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is part 3 - analysis of Report 5. "

    "\n",
    "Get the raw data (in PDF....!)\n",
    "You can find the ARCOS reports here: https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/arcos/retail_drug_summary/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six ARCOS reports published each year and I chose to work with three of them in particular:\n",
    "* Report 1:  Retail Drug Distribution by Zip Code for Each State - total drug amounts (in grams) distributed to retail registrants in each state, by 'gateway' zip code (the first three numbers of the zip), on a quarterly basis\n",
    "* Report 3: Quarterly Distribution in Grams per 100K Population - quarterly drug consumption in grams per 100,000 population, by state\n",
    "* Report 5: Statistical Summary for Retail Drug Purchases - average annual purchases by drug by business activity (pharmacy, hospital, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "* For years before 2006, the reports are lumped together into one giant PDF (700+ pages long). In more recent years they have elected to publish a separate PDF for each report. \n",
    "\n",
    "* I tried several approaches for simply getting the text out of the PDF - for a variety of reasons (in particular the unwieldy nature of the pre-2006 PDFs), it was easiest and quickest to just copy-paste the entire contents of the PDF into a text file. This was an OK solution for me since there aren't that many of them - if you were doing this with hundreds of files you would want to find another way. Another problem I ran into right away was the length of the title running onto multiple lines in the txt file and causing a lot of formatting challenges in a dataframe, so I manually adjusted the title text in each txt file. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For the pre-2006 reports, I (manually and carefully) removed the report content I wasn't interested in from the text file, and then used pandas to clean what remained. "

    "In this notebook we will be working with Report 5, the distribution by retail activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 - Getting from PDF to pandas in the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What to consider and experiment with:\n",
    "* How will you pull the data out of the PDF? How much of the formatting (columns, headers, etc) will you be able to preserve?\n",
    "* What delimiter works best?\n",
    "* If the number of PDF files is small, are there any steps you can perform right in the txt or spreadsheet file that will make things easier?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different options for getting data from a PDF into a format you can interact with more directly. I ended up just copy-pasting the full contents of each file as it didn't seem that some of the PDF-to-spreadsheet/other tools out there would really save me that much time. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried several text editors and spreadsheet applications, looking for something that would do a relatively good job delimiting the data based on the PDF files. Sublime is one of my favorites and that's what I used in the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tips\n",
    "* Try a couple different editors and delimit options, and read each one into pandas to see how the structure of the data looks. Choose one that will minimize the amount of cleaning you need to do\n",
    "* Keep your .txt file open as you begin cleaning in pandas\n",
    "* Never save over your raw .txt file! This is a trial-and-error process and you will likely end up losing some data at one point or another. If you've saved over the starting point you will have to go back to your PDF...\n",
    "\n",
    "These were the nastiest by far in terms of formatting and I ended up with many versions of the cleaning function. My approach to this was to run the function line by line when it failed to process a file correctly, find the issue and fix it and allow that to be a separate new function. You could take the extra step of refactoring them all into one version."
